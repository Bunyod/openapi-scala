    enfore API for managing contacts (incl. customers, suppliers and staff)

    Contacts are entities that the organization has dealings with.
    Contacts can be split into individual contacts (i.e., human persons) and organization contacts (i.e., other organizations/businesses).
    Additionally, contacts can have roles such as being a supplier, a customer, or a staff member. A single contact can have multiple roles, for example staff members are often also customers.
